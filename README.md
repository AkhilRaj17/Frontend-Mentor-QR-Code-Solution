# Frontend-Mentor-QR-Code-Solution
This is a solution to the QR code challenge on Frontend Mentor. Frontend Mentor challenges helped me improve my coding skills by building projects.

## Built with
- HTML5
- CSS custom properties
-  Flexbox
-  Mobile-first Design

## What I have learned

I learned how to use Flexbox to center the content both horiztonally and vertically. This allowed me to make a responsive design. This experience has enhanced my ability to create well-structured and web layouts for future projects.

## Continued development
In my first Frontend Mentor project, I've come to realize that there's still much to learn and explore in the world of web development. I'm enthusiast with various methods for centering designs, seeking out best practices to improve the quality of my code.
